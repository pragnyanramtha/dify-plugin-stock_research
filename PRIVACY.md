Privacy Policy for Real-time Stock Researcher Dify Plugin
Effective Date: June 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Real-time Stock Researcher" Dify Plugin (the "Plugin") processes information when you use it within your Dify applications (Chatflows, Workflows, or Agents).

1. Introduction
The Real-time Stock Researcher Dify Plugin is designed to retrieve public information regarding real-time stock prices and related data by integrating with external financial APIs. This Plugin operates as a bridge, forwarding your requests to a financial API and presenting the retrieved information back to you within Dify.

2. Information We Process
When you use the Plugin, the following information is involved:

Input Data: The only personal data we directly process via the Plugin's input is the symbol (stock ticker symbol) you provide to search for.

API Keys/Endpoints: Your Financial API Key and Endpoint URL (if applicable) are securely stored within your Dify environment's plugin credentials. The Plugin accesses these credentials only to authenticate and direct its requests to the financial API.

3. How Information is Used
The symbol you provide is used solely for the purpose of constructing a query to the integrated financial API to retrieve relevant stock price information. The retrieved information is then returned to your Dify application.

The Plugin itself does not store, log, or retain any of the symbol inputs or the information retrieved from the financial API beyond the immediate processing of your request.

4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
To fulfill your request, the symbol you provide will be transmitted to the Financial API (a third-party service, e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub). By using this Plugin, you acknowledge and agree that your symbol query will be shared with the chosen financial API for the purpose of executing the search.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the third-party financial API. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of the specific financial API you integrate with to understand how they collect, use, and share your information.

5. Data Retention
As stated above, the Plugin does not retain any of your input data or retrieved stock information. The processing is real-time and ephemeral. Information retention, if any, for your queries would be governed by the financial API's data retention policies and Dify's platform policies.

6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the Plugin itself from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. While the Plugin handles your API key securely via Dify's credential management, you are responsible for keeping your Dify credentials and financial API key confidential.

7. Your Rights
Since the Plugin does not store your data, direct access, correction, or deletion requests regarding data processed by the Plugin should be directed to the Dify platform (for your interaction history) or to the financial API (for any data they might retain related to API calls made from your account).

8. Disclaimer: Not Financial Advice
THIS PLUGIN IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINANCIAL ADVICE OR A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL, OR HOLD ANY SECURITIES. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL CONSULTATION. ALWAYS CONSULT WITH A QUALIFIED FINANCIAL ADVISOR OR PROFESSIONAL FOR ADVICE REGARDING YOUR SPECIFIC FINANCIAL SITUATION OR INVESTMENT DECISIONS. NEVER DISREGARD PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL ADVICE OR DELAY IN SEEKING IT BECAUSE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THIS PLUGIN.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Plugin's listing or associated documentation within the Dify platform. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

10. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Plugin's data practices, please contact the Plugin developer (pragnyanramtha) through the Dify platform's support channels.
